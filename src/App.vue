      <p>
        Our society is currently relying heavily on fossil fuels to provide
        energy to our industries, keep our homes at comfortable temperatures
        and move goods and persons around the globe. However, limiting climate
        change will require us to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses and
        by phasing out the use of fossil fuels. As a result, the demand for fossil
        fuels will evolve differently in the future than what we have seen in the
        past. This has consequences for investors in the fossil fuel sector.<br /><br />
        In this module we show the change in risks associated with investing
        in the fossil fuel sector to explain why investors should consider climate
        policy in their decisions.

        All fossil fuels will be prone to risks. However, specific risks can be
        visualized through examples. The first risk that will be examinated,
        for example, is related to quantity and can be easily explained by looking
        at coal.

        While it is clear that coal is phase out quickly with climate policies,
